Blackjack is Fun
================
Run `python blackjack_main.py` and follow instructions.

## Instructions

1. Game begins with a shuffled shoe (ie playing deck of cards).
2. Player puts down his bet (at least 1 chip).
3. Player and Dealer each receive 2 cards. Dealer shows 1 card and hides the other (hole card).
4. Aces can be interpreted two ways: Soft (11 pts) or Hard (1 pt)
5. If Player or Dealer gets a Blackjack (Ace & Face card or 10 card) in the first two, he reveals it and wins the game.
6. Otherwise, Player gets to choose if he wants to Hit, Stand, Surrender or Double Wager. Surrender is only possible as first decision of the round.
7. If Hit, Player receives another card. If Surrender, Player gives up half his bet and finishes the round. If Double, Player doubles his bet and picks up only one more card.
8. If Stand, Player ends his turn and lets Dealer take over.
9. Dealer now takes his turn. He reveals his hole card and hits until he reaches or exceeds 17 pts. Then he stands.
10. The person who exceeds 21 pts automatically loses. Otherwise the person who has the greater number of pts wins.
11. If both have the same number of pts, they tie and neither loses anything.
